What is PhonePe Pulse?
The PhonePe Pulse website showcases more than 2000+ Crore transactions by consumers on an interactive map of India. With over 45% market share, PhonePe's data is representative of the country's digital payment habits. The insights on the website and in the report have been drawn from two key sources - the entirety of PhonePe's transaction data combined with merchant and customer interviews. The report is available as a free download on the PhonePe Pulse website and GitHub.

The aim of our project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in a POSTGRESQL database.

Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
